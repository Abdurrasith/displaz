{"name":"Displaz","tagline":"A las viewer for geospatial LiDAR data","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\n**displaz** is a cross platform viewer for displaying LiDAR point clouds and high level features deduced from such point clouds.  The interface is optimised for viewing airborne laser scans of geographic data, but should also work for point clouds taken from other sources.\r\n\r\ndisplaz is intended to be a highly flexible technical tool for exploring LiDAR point data sets and vector geometry arising from them.  Display of point data is fully programmable through the power of OpenGL shaders.\r\n\r\n### Usage quickstart\r\n\r\nUse File->Open to open a las file - for example [autzen-colorized-1.2-3.laz](http://www.liblas.org/samples/autzen-colorized-1.2-3.laz).  Note that displaz may appear unresponsive when loading very large files - just wait for it and it should eventually finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Navigation\r\n\r\n* Click and drag the left mouse button to rotate\r\n* Click the middle mouse button to centre the camera on the closest point under the mouse\r\n* Click and drag the right mouse button to zoom, or use the mouse wheel\r\n\r\n#### Point display\r\n\r\nTo change how the points are displayed, use the controls in the box on\r\nthe right hand side of the screen.  Examples:\r\n\r\n* To change the point radius, click and *vertically drag* on the arrows of the spinbox labeled \"Point Radius\".  This extension works for all spinboxes containing real numbers; somewhat nonstandard but extremely convenient.\r\n* To view in colour, select \"Colour\" from the Colour Mode drop down box.\r\n\r\n#### Shader editing\r\n\r\nAdditional point display controls may be added and configured at runtime via hints in the the shader program.  While in the shader editor (accessible via the view menu), pressing Shift+Return will cause a valid shader to be recompiled and applied to the point cloud immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supported file formats\r\n\r\n#### Point cloud input\r\n\r\nThe primary file format is the ASPRS .las format; compressed .laz is also supported.  Internally these formats are read using the laszip library (via LASlib) so any standards-conforming las file should be read correctly.\r\n\r\nVery basic plain text import is also supported: Each line of a .txt file will be interpreted as `X Y Z ...` where the trailing part of the line is ignored.\r\n\r\n#### Vector geometry\r\n\r\nBasic support for vector geometry (meshes and line segments) is available via the .ply file format.  Any .ply file containing a header of the form\r\n\r\n    element vertex <N>\r\n    property float x\r\n    property float y\r\n    property float z\r\n    element face <M>\r\n    property list uchar int vertex_index\r\n\r\nwill be recognised and rendered as a mesh with solid faces.  When the face element is replaced with an edge element in the same format, each edge will be rendered as a set of linear segments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supported Systems\r\n\r\ndisplaz is intended to be cross-platform, and runs on both windows and linux.  It should also work on OSX with minimal effort, but the author doesn't have access to an OSX system for testing.\r\n\r\ndisplaz uses modern OpenGL features, so requires a reasonably up to date graphic driver.  It is known to work well with recent nvidia and ATI drivers.  Some problems have been reported with older ATI and intel drivers - these will be fixed in the future where possible.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
